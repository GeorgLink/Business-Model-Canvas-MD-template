<p>Hybrid Commute adopts a self-service model that provides users with an on-boarding guide and a Help Center with FAQs. We aim to provide flexible, real-time support to customers across multiple channels such as social media, apps, SMS, phone, chat, e-mail, and other software integrations, with access to a support representative for more assistance when needed.

A long with the self-service strategy, we draw on an automated-service model, which maintains relationships with our customers by providing AI (artificial intelligence) powered recommendations of travel route and insights to resources (e.g. restaurants, shopping, etc.) near end destinations.

To better understand our customer needs and expectations, we create a community forum around our products and services, where they can exchange knowledge, get helps and find advice among fellow users.

Last but not least, Hybrid Commute uses co-creation strategy in which we upload videos and podcast to promote user-generated content. This will help answer user questions and allows consumers to submit ideas, designs or content</p>
